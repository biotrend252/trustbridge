## Demo Video Script (3-5 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm presenting TrustBridge - a privacy-preserving cross-border remittance platform built with Chainlink Runtime Environment. TrustBridge solves the $30 billion problem of high remittance fees while maintaining privacy and compliance."

### Problem Statement (30 seconds)
"Traditional remittances are expensive, slow, and lack privacy. Users pay 6-7% in fees, wait days for transfers, and have all transaction details exposed publicly. TrustBridge fixes this."

### Architecture Overview (60 seconds)
**Show diagram:**
"TrustBridge uses CRE to orchestrate five key components:
1. Confidential KYC verification - API keys never exposed
2. AI-powered routing - finds cheapest cross-chain path
3. Private FX rate fetching - premium rates stay confidential
4. Real-time risk monitoring - sanctions screening
5. Private transactions - transfer details hidden onchain"

### Live Demo (90 seconds)
**Screen recording:**
1. "User initiates $1000 USD to EUR transfer"
2. "CRE workflow executes - watch the logs"
3. "KYC verified privately"
4. "AI finds optimal route: Ethereum → Polygon"
5. "FX rate fetched: 0.92 EUR/USD"
6. "Risk assessment: Low risk, approved"
7. "Private transaction executed"
8. "Recipient receives €918 in 3 minutes"

### Technical Highlights (45 seconds)
**Show code snippets:**
- "Confidential HTTP keeps API credentials private"
- "AI routing saves 40% on fees vs direct routes"
- "Private transactions hide amounts and recipients"
- "Smart contracts verify Proof of Reserve"

### Prize Track Alignment (30 seconds)
"TrustBridge targets four prize tracks:
- Privacy: Confidential HTTP + Private Transactions
- AI: Intelligent routing optimization
- Risk & Compliance: Real-time monitoring
- DeFi: Stablecoin infrastructure with PoR"

### Closing (15 seconds)
"TrustBridge makes remittances fast, cheap, and private. Built on CRE's institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you!"
